But I don't know were to copy this, and where to put that in my Android project. Could someone help me?

I copied this file into my gitIgnore file in Android Studio, but when I have pushed that project on gitHub my gitnigore file looks like this:

*.iml
.gradle
/local.properties
/.idea/workspace.xml
/.idea/libraries
.DS_Store
/build
/captures
